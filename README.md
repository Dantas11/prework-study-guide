# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for bootcamp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes for each module learned at the prework such as HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. It was build to help students to have acces to notes learned, which could be helpful along the bootcamp. By using Devtools you will have acces to a list of topics and notes and study suggestion. Building this study guide we learned to have a developer mindset, Git and Github (Repository, Issues, Github flow), HTML to give structure, CSS to define style and JavaScript to make interactive.
